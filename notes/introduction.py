#* Introduction - Python **

# Python is a high-level, interpreted, and generally easy-to-learn programming language. It was created
# by Guido van Rossum and its first version was released in 1991. Since then, Python has has become very
# popular in the software development community due to its clear syntax and readable, as well as its
# versatility.

# Main Features **

# 1. **Readability:**
# Python syntax is designed to be clear and easy to understand, making it easier to write
# and reading the code. This makes Python a great language for beginners and contributes
# to faster development.

# 2. **Interpreted:**
# Python is an interpreted language, meaning it does not need to be compiled before running
# the code. This facilitates experimentation and iterative development.

# 3. **Versatile:**
# Python is used in a wide variety of applications, from web development to analysis
# data, artificial intelligence, task automation and much more. Its versatility makes it
# in a valuable tool in different fields.

# 4. **Active Community:**
# Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute libraries and
# additional modules. This facilitates code reuse and speeds up project development.

# How to Run Python Code**

# To run a program in Python, you will need the Python interpreter installed on your machine.
# You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). Once
# installed, you can create a file with a `.py` extension and write your code in a text editor.
# Then, run the program from the command line or terminal using `python filename.py
#`.

# Basic Example**

# Here is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!":

print("Hello World")

# This is just a quick look at Python. As you explore further, you'll discover its many libraries
# frameworks and their application in a variety of fields. Enjoy programming in Python!.
