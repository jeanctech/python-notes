
#* Variables - Python

# In Python, variables are used to store data. Unlike some languages
# programming that requires explicit type declarations, Python is a dynamically typed language,
# meaning that the type of a variable is automatically inferred based on the value it contains.
# Here is some basic information about variables in Python:

#? Declaration and Assignment of Variables:

# In Python, you do not need to declare the type of a variable before using it. You can assign a value to a
# variable as follows:

#? Assigning a value to a variable

variable_name = 20 #AssignedValue

#? Examples:

# Integers
age = 25

# Floating point (decimal number)
price = 19.99

# Text strings
name = "John"

# Booleans
is_of_age = True

#? Naming Conventions:

# It is good practice to follow naming conventions to make your code more readable. Some
# common conventions include:

#
# - Variables usually have lowercase names.
# - For compound names, the snake_case convention is used (lowercase words separated by hyphens
# low).

full_name = "Juan Perez"

#? Operations with Variables:

# You can perform various operations with variables, depending on their type:

# Operations with numbers
result = age + 5

# Concatenation of text strings
message = "Hello, " + name

# Logical operations with booleans
is_adult = age >= 18

#? Type of data:

# Python supports several data types, including:

# - **int:** Integers
# - **float:** Floating point numbers
# - **str:** Text strings
# - **bool:** Booleans
# - **list:** Lists (mutable sequences)
# - **tuple:** Tuples (immutable sequences)
# - **dict:** Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
# - **set:** Sets (unordered collections of single elements)

#? Complete Example:

# Variable declaration and assignment
name = "Mary"
age = 30
height = 1.75
is_student = False

# Operations with variables
age_in_ten_years = age + 10
greeting = "Hello, " + name

# Print results
print("Name:", name)
print("Age in ten years:", age_in_ten_years)
print("Greeting:", greeting)

# These are just basics about variables in Python. As you progress in your learning,
# you will be able to explore more advanced features and use variables in more complex contexts.
# Have fun programming in Python!
